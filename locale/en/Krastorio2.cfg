	k_more_waste=Adds stone into recipe for enriching iron and copper.
	k_powerful-beacon=Makes "Singularity beacon" twice as powerful. That is, makes it the same as it was before version 1.2.11. The beacon had to be changed because it was too powerful and caused some bugs in the game. Enabling this option is NOT RECOMMENDED, but if the update broke your factory or ratios, then you can enable it. It will not break your game. More information about this bug is written in the changelog (1.2.11 update).
	k_scale_info_icons=Increases the size of the icons that display the contents in large chests and warehouses.
	keep-infinite-technology=If technology rebalance is enabled, and this option is enabled, infinite technologies remain infinite(and other become infinite), otherwise will be limited (default: false)
	loaders=Adds loaders. You can turn it off and use your own.
	long-hands=Like Long Reach, but less cheat.
	multy-ore=Multiply in ore recipes(smelting): ingredients and products and time (the work/time yield don't change). This is for reduce the overmodules effect on furnaces that break the game products computation on tick(default: enabled)

	productivity-beacon=Enable productivity effect in beacons and in singularity beacons(default: disabled)
	reb-beacon=Doubles the beacon module slot(default: enabled)

	reb-damage=Rebalance all damage done by player weapons (Turrets, ammo...)(default: enabled)
	reb-decorative-removal=Set Decorative Removal = 95% for vanilla covering. If this option turn on, then when you place a ground covering, such as concrete, grass and bushes will be removed with a 95% probability. If this option turn off, then you have grass and bushes on you concrete and stone bricks (vanilla).
	reb-fuel=Useful option if you play with difficult enemies. You can also disable this option if you want to complicate the game.
	reb-nuclear=Everything is redone. Now you can build compact and powerfull Nuclear stations. It's very efficient and ups-frendly, but produce fuel become much more expensive. In vanilla 100k uranium ore give 3k uranium-235, now around 0.8k-1k. Also reduced bonus from a neighbor and...never destroy a working reactor! This part of mod highly recommended.
	reb-oil=Remove infinite oil. It's ok and recommended.
	reb-ore=HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Rebalance ore conusme from 1 to 3 for increase the difficulty. ATTENTION! Krastorio is balanced on this setting, if is disabled the recipes balancing will be compromised(default: enabled)
	reb-power-poles=Increases the size of the supply area and the length of the connection.
	reb-radar=Increases coverage, but also increases power consumption.
	reb-rounds=Adds coal into the "firearm magazine" recipe and makes "piercing rounds magazine" cheaper.
	reb-science-packs=More balanced recipes for Krastorio. Highly recommended.
	reb-stack-size=Increases stacks. Mainly for resources.
	reb-technology=Changes vanilla technology. Highly recommended.
	reb-train=If enabled, train cargo space is higher but train will consume more fuel, this is meant for reduce train deliveries (default: enabled)
	unlock-deep-drill=Allows you to mine rich rocks anywhere. Too cheat. Not recommended to turn on this option if you play with SE mod.
