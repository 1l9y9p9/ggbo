	fusion-reactor=Fusion reactor
	shelter=Shelter
	fusion-reactor-description-1=Fusion reactor [entity=kr-fusion-reactor] is the successor of nuclear reactor [entity=nuclear-reactor], instead use nuclear fission to generate energy this reactor use nuclear fusion, this is a cleaner process (fusion is radiation [img=virtual-signal/kr-nuclear-2] free!).\nDifferently from the nuclear reactor, this entity don't produce heat but have boiler directly inside, so need that water [fluid=water] is provider in one of the active fluid input spots, and after the process on the fluid output will be released the steam for be inserter in advanced steam turbines [item=kr-advanced-steam-turbine].
	fusion-reactor-description-2=For produce energy this reactor consume Deuterium-Tritium fuel [item=dt-fuel] (that in our game the production process is approximated using tritium [item=tritium] and heavy water [fluid=heavy-water]).  
	info-description=Select an item from the list on the left to read information about it.
	shelter-description-1=The shelter [entity=kr-shelter] is the players "temporary" home. When a team (force) place a shelter on the map the team spawnpoint will be setted in front of it (each team can have only one spawnpoint at a time), with this a team can choose where respawn when something goes wrong... [color=orange]but remember! Can exist only one shelter for surfarce for each team![/color], in the case you play without mods that add new surface, Factorio have only one surface that is Nauvis, in this case you can place only one shelter at a time, if you want change the spawnpoint simply remove it and replace it where you want.\nAlso you can preserve inside your video game magazines for when you want to take a break, shelters[color=green] has 200 slot for store items and give 120kW of passive power [img=virtual-signal/kr-energy-2][/color].
	air-purifier-description-1=Air Purifiers [entity=kr-air-purifier] are buildings that purify the atmosphere near them (in their chunk) by consuming filters [item=pollution-filter].\nThe game map is divided in square zones (called chunks) and each of them contains a certain amount of pollution. The Air Purifier [color=red]will purify only the chunk where it is placed[/color], and will keep doing it even after the chunk has been completely cleaned.\nTo let a purifier remove the pollution in nearby chunks, you will have to wait for the game to naturally spread pollution from adjacent chunks into the purifier chunk.\nIt's normal to see the area near purifiers surrounded by pollution. To reduce this effect we advise to think about how to place purifiers near your factories.\nTo see chunks on the map you can use mods or the Factorio debug view (default keybind F4 -> show-tile-grid).
	air-purifier-description-2=Once the purifier has consumed a filter there is a [color=orange]90% probability[/color] to get back a dirty filter [item=used-pollution-filter] that can be cleaned to use it again.\n\nYou can see how much pollution is purified from the production statistics panel (open it with __CONTROL__production-statistics__). The purified amount equals the consumed amount.
	inserters-krastorio-hotkey-description-1=In Krastorio 2 you can press __CONTROL__kr-inserter-change-lane__ while the mouse is over an inserter to change the transport belt lane where the inserter drops items.\nSuccessfully changing drop lane will show a graphical effect and the drop arrow (visible in alt-view) will shift slightliy.	The hotkey __CONTROL__kr-inserter-change-lane__ can be changed in the Factorio control settings.\n\nMoreover, Krastorio 2 enables "burner leech" for all burner inserters. This means that when a burner inserter needs fuel it can grab it from both the grab side (as normal) and the drop side (normally impossible).
	radiation-description-1=Krastorio 2 adds radiation damage. When a player gets near a uranium ore deposit he can suffer radiation damage. This also happens if his inventory contains items made from uranium.\nTo reduce this effect it is sufficient to wear armor. Better armor gives better radiation damage reduction.\n\nUranium-based ammunitions do not emit radiation but can inflict radiation damage to targets. This type of damage is very effective against biters as they don't have radiation resistance.
	roboports-krastorio-hotkey-description-1=In Krastorio 2 you can press __CONTROL__kr-change-roboport-state__ while the mouse is over a roboport to change its work mode. The available modes are:\n- Normal Mode\n- Logistic Mode\n- Construction Mode\nRoboports in logistic or construction mode will offer coverage only to, respectively, logistic or construction robots. Normal mode offers coverage to both.\nThe hotkey __CONTROL__kr-change-roboport-state__ can be changed in the Factorio control settings.
