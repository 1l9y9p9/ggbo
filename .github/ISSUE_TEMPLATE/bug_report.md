4. See error

Be certain to reproduce the issue on the same save file that you upload.

#### Save file & Username

Upload the save file where the bug occured. If the file is too large for GitHub, use an alternative file service.

**ALTERNATIVELY:** Reproduce the issue on a brand-new save file, provide any needed blueprints and instructions, and attach another brand-new save file to this issue.

**ALTERNATIVELY:** If the issue is a crash on startup (the game shows an error before you get to the main menu), then disable Krastorio 2, create a new save, and upload that save file.

Please also provide your in-game username so we can reproduce the conditions exactly.
